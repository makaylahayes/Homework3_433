```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Problem 1
```{r}
temp<-flights%>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  mutate(avg_arr_delay=mean(arr_delay,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  select(tailnum,avg_arr_delay)
planestemp<-planes%>%
  select(tailnum,year)
final<-temp%>%
  left_join(planestemp, by = "tailnum")
head(final)

```

Problem 2
```{r}
pr2<-flights%>%
  mutate(day_of_year=date(time_hour))%>%
  group_by(day_of_year,origin)%>%
    summarise(num_sched=sum(!is.na(sched_dep_time)))%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = origin,values_from = num_sched)
head(pr2)
```
Problem 3
Each NA means there were no flights that day that came into that airport from any of the New York airports
```{r}
pr3<-flights%>%
  mutate(day_of_year=yday(time_hour))%>%
  group_by(day_of_year,dest)%>%
    summarise(num_arrive=sum(!is.na(arr_time)))%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = dest,values_from = num_arrive)
head(pr3)
```
